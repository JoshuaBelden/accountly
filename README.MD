## Up and Running Locally

### Setup MongoDB

You will first need an instance of MongoDB available for the backend api. The easiest way to accomplish that is to use Docker. You can run the following commands to run the latest version of MongoDB.

```
docker pull mongo
docker run -p 27017:27017 -d mongo
```
